			<div class="blog-title">its not over and you should feel bad</div>
			<div class="blog-text">
				<span>im tired, boss. im tired of "feeling the agi". im tired of seeing frontends of sales pipelines pitched as real products. im tired of hearing "its over" when in reality its just beginning. there is no reality in which you can convince me that software is going away, when truthefully the need for it only goes up and up. LLMs are about to become a *highly* guarded resources, in terms of untainted training data, ad-free token streaming (lol), etc, and if you spent one of the most unprecedented learning opportunities in our lifetime thinking you don't need something as fundamental as git in software then maybe it really is over (for you). so anyways, feel bad about your skills, be embarrassed, but more importantly git gud, and stop waiting for the rest of humanity to surpass you.</span>

			<div class="blog-title">be opinionated, but</div>
			<div class="blog-text">
				<span>working in software and corpo software specifically gives a strange edge to technical interactions. whether you know too much or, far more likely, too little, you risk taking the room hostage with opinionation. it is admittedly true that you can spend way too much time gold-plating an application that simply doesn't require it, but it is important to be as correct and performant as possible/when possible.</span></br></br>
				<span>my team at work recently spent some time spinning up a maintenance application for our company's fleet of microservices. something like ~6k application/version pairs are deployed at any one time, and we need a way to manage deployment instances securely and quickly. important to note however that this is not something that should expect huge load, it will run on a schedule and reasonable performance metrics are acceptable to get it out the door.</span></br></br>
				<span>i did a lot of the actual key clacking for this project (with claude) and got spun up relatively quickly -- podman, sqs queues, gitops/yaml parsing, realtively straightforward stuff. a metadata problem and a missed requirement quickly had us rushing to get things out however, but delivered and executed without issue.</span></br></br>
				<span>the problem now becomes this middle state, what to do now? the application runs fine -- parses a (rather large) gitops repo, composites several complicated lookup tables for application:image metadata, submits jobs for processing, process build jobs, rebuilds, no issue. However that rush at the end left things in a state i would rather go back and clean up. here lies the conflict -- how much time do i have to go clean up my mess? i would argue that since i know it can be better, its my _responsibility_ as an engineer (yea i said it) to go fix up the codebase where i can, streamlime, generalize, abstract, i want more power where i can put it. but someone wearing more of a product manager hat might scoff at this notion. "you want to fix a performant and functioning application?"</span></br></br>
				<span>as with all things in life i think the correct balance is somewhere in the middle. corporate doesnt need perfect software, but i want to make my life and the lives of other devs as easy as i can, as well as enjoy watching my performant application run. lean too hard to product mind and you seem like you dont really care, lean too hard to gold-plating/perfection, it seems like youre dawdling. i guess ill just do what i can and focus on making my work as clean as possible :]

			<div class="blog-title">embarrassing yourself professionally</div>
			<div class="blog-text">
				<span>humility is a strange concept in its most basic form. confidence is required to some extent in any context; if you dont believe in yourself, why should anyone? however, belittle yourself too aggresively or often and you risk betraying a reddit-like quality about yourself. like all things, i suppose the answer is in balance somewhere -- be confident and foolhardy enough to convince yourself you can do anything, but humble and willing to accept when you need help.</span><br><br>
				<span>these conflicting ideals have followed me around for a while, and i have found myself leaning towards both ends of the spectrum at different points in my life. no one wants to be around an eor (i cant do anything) or a yacine (i can do it in 2 weeks), because they come off as pathetic and arrogant respectively. knowing where and when to move the needle is an important soft skill that i am constantly tuning my internal mechanism for, and not something i ever really plan on 'mastering'.</span><br><br>
				<span>certainly, there is never one correct configuration of daring and caution, confidence/humility, etc. it is more about the information you expose to those around you, and optimizing for that in the long run is probably not worth chasing. so -- embarrass yourself, go out on a limb, take on new challenges, but fail gracefully. be modest in victory and humble in defeat, and you'll be respected for the former and forgiven in the latter. or you wont, and everyone will hate you, but then you probably want to move around a bit anyways right?

			<div class="blog-title">doing things the hard way quickly</div>
			<div class="blog-text">
				<span>some quick thoughts i had while doing some site refactoring: i have always resonated with doing things the hard way in any capacity of learning at least once. there are lots of easy ways to get things done quickly in any discipline, but especially in tech with the advent of better coding LLMs and technical resources. you should use these tools early on to prevent spinning your wheels on something simplistic instead of allocating your time to areas of work that actually require rigorous study. HOWEVER -- it should be understood that you have to do whatever you are learning the hard way, on your own, with no tooling. treat it as a test of your knowledge -- if the internet was turned off tomorrow, could you still ship this new service from scratch? its a very dangerous mindset to assume you understand something without breaking the material down into its most basic terms. simplicity is your friend, but also your harshest critic, and if you can't reconstruct the functionality without taking a quick peek at your tooling, then you don't know it well enough yet. so do it fast and dirty, slop it together, but make sure it *works*, and you do it *alone*. then iterate, and use all the tooling you want to make it perfomant.</span>

			<div class="blog-title">personal projects: stack ramblings</div>
			<div class="blog-text">
				<span>i recently started up an additional side project (just one more domain bro) and found myself thinking about what tech stack i should use to explore this idea. there are so many js frameworks to explore and trendy backend langs to deep dive into it can all be a bit overwhelming. certainly all of them are worth exploring, all in pursuit of becoming a better devloper right? i guess the question becomes *why* are you wanting to put time into this language? do you want a backend go position? trying to explore a new alternative to c (zig, c3)? i think all optios have merit but eventually most of us just want to learn more about web/application development at a deeper level. for that reason i chose to do just a plain html/css/js frontend stack, with a c++ api. its a bit absurd, considering i could just use php, but it feels nice to add complexity for no reason and figure out the intricacies. i am using crow for routing/http response support, so still a bit of it is abstracted away. but dealing with database interactions, 3rd party idP integrations and real-time data transactions in a low(er) level language is a fun challenge.</span><br><br>
				<span>the project is called sharedlist (wip), and its essentially version control for music playlists. you can integrate with spotify and apple music (theoretically), and sync a sharedlist with a playlist on your account to try and pull changes, request a change, etc. (git for music? lol) development is under way but i imagine it will take a month or so before i can get a fully functional git for music running. a lot of the challenge runs in learning nginx properly as well as some linux best practices for running services and the like. ill post a link when its somewhat ready to be viewed/used!</span>

			<div class="blog-title">chess ai and reinforcement learning</div>
			<div class="blog-text">
			<span>my one major foray into ai/ml/rl/{?} has been the training of my own chess bot. had the humble mnist beginnings as many do and decided that i could easily do this on my own, and quickly realized i had a lot of work in front of me. data collection seemed like an issue at first, but chess dot com actually has some great public apis that i was able to take advantage of. i converted each game into a series of fen positions and encoded each fen into an 8x8x13 tensor (8 ranks/files if you are familiar with chess, and then 13 possible states for each square.(piece type, color, empty)).</span>
			<br>
			<br>
			<span> you can play my latest inference model </span> <a href="/chess.html">here</a> <span>, but don't expect anything special. the bot is essentially an openings book, it displays a litte strategy in the early middlegame but that is mostly because all of my opening choices revolve around the center and putting pressure on pieces that protect the center. quality quickly degrades if you play extremely aggressively (in a "bad" way, ie capturing defended pieces etc). my bot appears to have an anuerysm when any unusual threat arises (just like me), and its unfortunately easy to exploit this.</span>
			<br>
			<br>
			<span> my current state with this project is trying to implement an actor-critic reinforcement learning system, where a value network assigns a scalar variable to certain positions based on future potential rewards, and the policy network (current model) navigates the decision making for all of these positions. thats a lot of words to say that both of these networks are incorporated in each others feedback loop and should improve together, increasing tactical decision making capabilities. </span>

		   <div class="blog-title">ubuntu, nginx and super quick web servers</div>
		   <div class="blog-text">
		   	<span>linux and owning a vps are things that modern devs *(know)* about but if you are like me its hardly ever used in practice. my company hosts all our infra on windows (i know), and most of my personal development is local to my computer. spinning up quick web servers and networking protocols is something i know about in practice -- firewalls, dns, public ip, host config etc, but rarely something i want to execute on my own since i know that there are gaps in my knowledge and i dont want to leave myself hanging.</span>
			<br><br>
			<span>so gives rise to "no-code"/"low-code" infrastructure setups that abstract all of this away from you (funny thought -- nginx is a low code solution already). in reality, its much easier to just use these packages already provied to you by the linux ecosystem, you just need to start configuring. just doing things (or starting things) is a great barrier in life not a lot of people are able to overcome, whether for convenience or lack of motivation. continuing my linux journey is an exciting prospect, and although i do feel green i have a level of familiarity on my side and plenty of confidence. :wq (just kidding)</span>

	           <div class="blog-text">
	               <span>lately i have been reading a lot about reinforcement learning and autonomous agents. it seems like the next big leap forward is going to come out of this space, and i have been trying to understand the math and architecture. it made me think about how an llm could integrate into different learning setups. in what configuration would an agent benefit from the capabilities of an llm? in some setups for example, two networks interact with each other and redefine an action taking policy for a given state. reward for these actions is defined by the value network and the policy network is trained to look for these rewards over time and create a high value trajectory thru action(s) /a/ in state /s/. in what possible scenarios could an llm acting as the policy network in this actor-critic setup improve the value /v/ derived from actions taken? one would imagine the model would need to getting constant fine tunes as well which could be extremely costly computationally.</span>

	               <span>is javascript actually man made horrors beyond our comprehension? i have been learning some more js frameworks and diving a litte bit more into pure js for my own site purposes as well as for work. i do enjoy component development and think it makes sense in a lot of directions, however enterprise is always going to be messy. i feel its more of a question of where you want the mess because you *will* have some. not sure if the front end is the place for that however? a lot of mid level eneterprise software solutions always seem to have ridiculous amounts of tech debt in the stored procs, and while jsenv is confusing at times, it can provide a lot of usefulness as well. d.r.y. done a lot of damage in general as a mantra in the industry but it does do a lot of good for the problem it is attempting to solve.</span>
